### Notes for IMaRS Bathymetry Working Group

### Three main focus areas:
1. Bathymetry
2. Habitat mapping (corals, seagrass, sand, hardbottom, etc.)
3. Coastline change

### Regions of interest:
1. Belize (CoPE)
2. Biscayne Bay and S. Florida (CoPE)
3. US Virgin Islands (CoPE and BlueGAP)
4. Tampa Bay (BlueGAP)

## Ideas for code sources
1. Bathymetry (Tylar may have ideas?)
2. Habitat mapping (Luis?)
3. Coastline change (example GEE code from paper)
